# rerdem-dev

This repository documents my C++ learning process.

## What I'm working on
- Core C++ fundamentals (functions, arrays, pointers)
- Algorithms and problem solving
- Console-based projects
- Foundations for game development

## Background
I am a student learning programming seriously.
My goal is to build strong fundamentals rather than rushing into frameworks.

## Notes
This repository will grow over time as I improve my skills and add projects.
